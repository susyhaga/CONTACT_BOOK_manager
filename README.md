# Getting Started with Create React App

## Description
"Although hardly anyone uses a phone contact list these days, I created one to practice state-altering actions such as adding new contacts, updating the user's contact list, as well as editing and deleting data. This is very useful for building registration systems that interact with APIs or databases that require modification. To develop this project, I used React-TypeScript, Redux, JSON, and other technologies. Since users can't access the local host where the API is hosted, I modified it and opted to create a mock database using initialState() with 400 standardized phone contacts, solely for testing purposes."
