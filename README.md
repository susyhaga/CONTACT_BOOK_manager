# Getting Started with Create React App

## Description
This TO-DO-LIST manager project enables users to effortlessly "add", "remove", "edit", "classify" and "create new tasks". User modifications are permanently saved in the browser's cache, eliminating the need for an API or database. As a single-page application (SPA), it allows users to seamlessly navigate to a separate route for task registration, leading to significantly faster page loading times.

## Features
* Add new tasks
* Remove existing tasks
* Edit tasks
* Storage in the browser's cache

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
